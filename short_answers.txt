What is source code?

Source code is the human-readable set of instructions written 
by a programmer in a programming language, which is then compiled 
or interpreted to create executable software.

What makes computers so “smart”, anyway? 
Computers are "smart" because they process vast amounts of data and 
execute complex algorithms at incredibly high speeds, 
following the precise instructions given by their programming.

What is the purpose of a programming language?
 A programming language allows humans to communicate with 
 computers by providing a set of rules and syntax for writing 
 code that the computer can execute.

What are 3 examples of programming languages?
 Why are there so many of these? Examples include Python, Java, and JavaScript. 
 There are many languages because different languages are suited for different tasks, 
 environments, and performance requirements.

What is a variable? Why are variables useful?
 A variable is a symbolic name associated with a value, 
 used to store and manipulate data within a program. 
 Variables are useful because they allow for dynamic and flexible code.

What is the difference between a single-equals (=) and a double-equals (==)? 
 A single-equals (=) is used for assignment, setting the value of a variable. 
 A double-equals (==) is used for comparison, checking if two values are equal.

What is the difference between a double-equals (==) and a triple-equals (===)?
 A double-equals (==) checks for value equality, performing type conversion if necessary. 
 A triple-equals (===) checks for both value and type equality without type conversion.

Why does the developer console exist? 
 The developer console exists to provide developers with tools to inspect, debug, and interact
 with their code and web applications in real time.

When we talk about “conditional” statements, what does that mean? What is an example? 
 Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 
 An example is an if statement: if (score >= 90) { grade = 'A'; }.

Why would we want FOR or WHILE loops in our source code? 
 We use FOR or WHILE loops to execute a block of code multiple times,
 enabling tasks such as iteration over arrays or repeated actions.

When would you use a WHILE loop, instead of a FOR loop?
 A WHILE loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand 
 and depends on a condition being met, while a FOR loop is used when the 
 number of iterations is predetermined.

What is a function? Why would we use functions?
 A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. 
 We use functions to organize code, promote reuse, and improve readability.

How many values can you receive back from a function? How many values can you send in? 
 A function can return a single value (though that value can be a collection like an array or object). 
 Functions can accept multiple input parameters.

What is an array? 
 How many values does it hold? An array is a data structure that holds a collection of values, 
 usually of the same type, indexed by their position. It can hold as many values as the system memory allows.

What is a T-diagram and why should I know how to use one? 
 A T-diagram is a visual tool used to help understand and trace variable values during the execution of code, 
 aiding in debugging and learning programming.

What are the two ways to comment JS code? When would you use one versus the other? 
 The two ways are single-line comments (// comment) and multi-line comments (/* comment */). 
 Use single-line comments for brief notes and multi-line comments for longer explanations or 
 to temporarily disable blocks of code.
